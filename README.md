On this repositery, we will look into two ways of switching a 1W lamp to different light levels depending on the outside light intensity.
The darker the room is the brighter our 1 W lamp is. 

For the first setup: we used a relay to either turn ON/OFF the light.

For the second setup: we used a power triac to change the light level to 4 different levels using PWM.

Enjoy!
